## Experiment for Figure 6(b) (Memory latency)
1.	Download and install tinymembench on host, BF-1, BF-2 and BF-3
git clone https://github.com/ssvb/tinymembench
cd tinymembench
git checkout tags/v0.4
make
2.	Run tinymembench on one of the host, BF-1,BF-2, and BF-3:
./tinymembench

The benchmark reports memory latency ranging from 64KB â€“ 64MB with both hugepages enabled and disabled.


## Experiment for Table II (Memory bandwidth)
1.	Download stream.c file from STREAM on host, BF-1, BF-2, and BF-3
wget https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/FTP/Code/stream.c
2.	Compile and run single core version as
gcc stream.c -o stream
./stream

Multi-core version as
gcc -fopenmp -D_OPENMP stream.c -o stream_multi
OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N> ./stream_multi
where <N> is 12, 16, 8, and 8 for host, BF-1, BF-2 and BF-3 respectively.
The output of STREAM benchmark would report memory bandwidth
